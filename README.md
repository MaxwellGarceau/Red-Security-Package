# Overview
Part of Red Earth Design's services included security packages to ensure sites did not have any malware and that WP Core as well as all of the plugins were updated.
Whoever was doing the upgrades would need to record what plugins were updated and record them in a spreadsheet as part of a deliverable report to the client.

## I created a plugin that would:

- Save the plugin version after the last upgrade
- Display the updated plugins since the last time
- Generate the report via a template for easily sending to the client
